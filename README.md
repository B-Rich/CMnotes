These are my notes on Classical Mechanics (advanced level), initially taken for the PHYS503 class lectured by Dr. Kenkre at the University of New Mexico, Fall 2012. \\ 

*Main_CM.tex* is the TeX code outlined the whole set of notes. 
The section on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics was modified from a LaTeX  source code provided by Ninnat (*Tom*) Dangniam (thank Tom for letting me sharing his works online). \\


These notes are now openly shared for academic purpose, and can be redistributed and revised under the MIT license. Because most of the notes were taken on-fly, there are definitely numerous errors. 
If you find any errors, please help update with a better version by request a Pull Request on the Git repository. Thanks for the contributions to these notes and derived works. Enjoy learning and creating! \\
